#Simple project template with Grunt, Bower etc

Just a starter for 10 which allows for rapid project setup with a Gruntfile, mainly for my own use but feel free to use it if it's handy enough.

This Gruntfile is based one that Wesley Todd uses in his [Yo WordPress](https://github.com/wesleytodd/YeoPress) [default template](https://github.com/wesleytodd/YeoPress/tree/template). Check it out, it's great if you use WordPress.
